# Scraper
A simple web scraper in Python

13 May 2016

## Description

A simple web scraper in Python which retrieves text (including html tags) from a specified URL (currently hard-coded). Text is edited to retrieve content between the html <body>..</body> tags. The edited text is then saved to a file (filename currently hard-coded).

Further improvements to be made:
* Add user-entry for URL and output filename;
* Add option to scrape multiple URLs.
